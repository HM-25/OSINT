What is OSINT?
Open source intelligence or OSINT, is often utilized by hackers and red teams,
to leverage public data while conducting investigations, often using database searches.

OSINT stands for open source intelligence and refers to the practice of collecting data from free sources 
that are available to the general public. As information becomes more available from a vast number of sources, 
skilled researchers can often find nearly any type of data they’re looking for, provided they know where to look. 
These sources include both public and private databases that hackers, journalists, spies, and ordinary people 
all use to do the work of collecting information every day.

Much of this information simply isn’t able to be retrieved through search engines and requires knowledge
of where the right database is located to get the right answers. Fortunately, there are a multitude of tools 
that both beginners and seasoned investigators can take advantage of to use OSINT sources while conducting research.
